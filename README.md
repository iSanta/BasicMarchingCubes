# Description
This is a basic example of the Marching cubes algorithm to create a basic shape and be able to modify it at run time.

I made this project with the idea of using it in a VR project for Oculus Quest 2, so I have to deploy it for Android, that is why in this project I don't use Compute shaders, this project runs on CPU and not GPU. so the performance is not pretty good, so in my case I will not use it in virtual reality, but it is an interesting basic example of the use of the algorithm.
